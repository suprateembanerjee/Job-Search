Currently I'm pursuing my Masters Degree at Northeastern University (Boston, US), on track to graduate in May 2024 with a major in Computer Science. I have a keen eye for the product and user experience/requirements when designing a product. I have worked in fast-paced work-environments with tight deadlines and I learned that I pick-up new technologies quickly which helps me iterate through prototypes faster. I can add great value to your ML Team and help build new experiences for your consumers. I'm seeking Full-time Software Engineering roles (in Data Science/ML/DL/ML Ops) starting August 2024. Feel free to message me :) Competencies: Machine Learning, ML Operations, Keras, Tensorflow (core, JS, Lite), Scikit-Learn, Computer Vision, Web Development, Django, Flask, CI/CD, Python/C/C++/Java, Cloud Tech (AWS, Azure, GCP) Accomplishments: Winner at HackHarvard Hackathon '22 for 'Best use of Google Cloud'.\"}"
